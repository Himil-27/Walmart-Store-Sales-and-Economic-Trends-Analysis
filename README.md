# Walmart-Store-Sales-Analysis
The project focuses on analyzing Walmartâ€™s weekly sales data across multiple stores, combined with economic indicators such as fuel price, CPI (Consumer Price Index), and unemployment rates. The primary goal is to understand sales patterns, assess the impact of holidays, and identify how external economic factors influence sales performance.
